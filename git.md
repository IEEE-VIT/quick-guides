# Let's hack GitHub

## Phase 0:

- Make sure you read [this](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) article explaining Git and Github thoroughly

## Phase 1: (Mandatory to do in the CLI)

- Initialise a repository
- Create a `yourFavoriteTopic.md`
- Plan 5 different sections in it
- Add each of them in 1 commit along with a proper commit message mentioned [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/)
- Beautify your markdown file. For Markdown syntax refer [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- Push all of them to Github <br/>
  `Ask a senior to have a look at you commits and the overall repo`

## Phase 2

- Now create an issue on your repo asking for a feature request to add yourFavoriteSeries.md
- Add the `feature request` label to the issue
- Assign this issue to yourself <br/>
  `Ask a senior to have a look at you repo and then proceed`

## Phase 3 (Mandatory on the CLI)

- Checkout to another branch whose name should be related to the Issue you opened
- Make meaningful commits on this branch just like we did for the master/main branch

## Phase 4

- Once you're done with it, Open a Pull Request from your new branch to the master/main branch
- Link this PR with the issue you created
- Add any of the seniors as Pull Request Reviewers

## Phase 5

- Wait for our feedback and if it is approved, Merge the PR
- If it is not, make changes and ask for a review again by mentioning them in the comments of the PR

### Congratulations :rocket: you are now well versed with the basics of Git and Github

### Legend

- Repo: Repository
- PR: Pull Request
- CLI: Command Line Interface
